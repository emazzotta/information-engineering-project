    librarianship, particularly prior to 1973. anything on the
    historical development of the librarian's christian fellowship
    would be of interest. also coverage of the group in the
    professional press since 1973, including their pronouncements
    and views of members and non-members of christian activity and
    attitudes in the profession (especially subjects like ethics,
